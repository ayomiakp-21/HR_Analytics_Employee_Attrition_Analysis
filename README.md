# Key Insights

## Executive summary

- Overall Attrition Rate: 16.36%
- Total Attrition: 243 employees out of 1,485
- Attrition is not evenly distributed, it is concentrated in:
  
     - Sales & R&D departments
     - Younger age groups (18–35)
     - Certain job roles (Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Lab Technician)
       
- Low job satisfaction and compensation indicators appear frequently in recent attrition cases
- Attrition is driven more by role design, career stage and engagement than demographics alone

## Department-wise Attrition

- Sales has the highest attrition volume
- R&D follows closely
- HR has comparatively low attrition
- Revenue-generating and technical roles face higher pressure, performance targets and burnout
- HR roles likely have clearer career paths and better work-life balance

## Job Role Analysis

Top roles by attrition count:

- Sales Executive
- Research Scientist
- Laboratory Technician
- Manufacturing Director
- Healthcare Representative
- Interpretation
- Frontline and specialist roles are:
  
   - More exposed to performance stress
   - Often have limited short-term growth visibility
   - Highly attractive to competitors (high external demand)

## Gender Analysis

- Male attrition is more Female attrition. However, attrition rate by gender appears relatively balanced
- Gender itself is not the primary driver
- Attrition is more role- and age-dependent

## Age Group Trends

- Employee attrition is highest among early-career age groups (18–26 and 27–35), indicating increased turnover risk in the initial stages of employment
- Attrition declines significantly after age 36, suggesting greater role stability and organizational commitment among mid- to late-career employees
- Early-career employees are more likely to:

   - Seek accelerated career growth and advancement opportunities
   - Switch jobs more readily in response to external market opportunities
   - Be highly sensitive to compensation, recognition and learning & development programs

- These patterns highlight the need for targeted retention strategies focused on career progression, skill development and competitive rewards for younger workforce segments

## Educational Field

- Attrition is highest among employees from Life Sciences, Medical and Marketing educational backgrounds, indicating increased turnover within these talent segments
- These educational fields are highly competitive in the labor market, with strong external demand for skilled professionals
- The transferability of skills in these domains makes it easier for employees to switch roles or organizations
- This trend suggests that attrition in these fields is driven less by role fit and more by market opportunities and career mobility
- Targeted retention efforts such as clear career pathways, upskilling programs and competitive compensation can help reduce turnover in these high-risk educational groups

## Survey & Satisfaction Scores

- Several job roles record low employee survey ratings (1–2), signaling dissatisfaction within specific segments of the workforce
- Low satisfaction scores are most prominent among Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives and Research Scientists
- These roles also experience higher attrition levels, indicating a strong correlation between low engagement and employee turnover
- The pattern suggests that attrition is driven by engagement and role-related factors, not compensation alone

## Recent Attrition Profiles

- Recent attrition cases show a consistent pattern of low job satisfaction scores (1) combined with relatively low percentage salary hikes (22–23%)
- Despite dissatisfaction with rewards, these employees maintain moderate to high performance ratings (4)
- This indicates that high-performing employees are exiting the organization, not due to poor performance but due to perceived undervaluation
- Key drivers of this attrition may include:

   - Limited recognition for performance
   - Lack of visible career growth or advancement opportunities

- This represents high-risk attrition, as the loss of strong performers has a disproportionate negative impact on productivity, knowledge retention and business outcomes

## Attrition Trend Over Time

- Attrition trends show early spikes followed by a gradual decline, indicating an initial period of higher workforce instability
- Recent periods reflect lower attrition levels, suggesting short-term improvement in employee retention
- The decline may be influenced by:

   - Organizational policy changes
   - Hiring slowdowns or freezes
   - Broader economic conditions affecting job mobility

- These improvements may be temporary and require ongoing monitoring to determine long-term sustainability and underlying drivers

# Strategic Recommendations

1.  Role-Specific Retention Programs

- Implement role-specific retention programs targeting high-attrition roles, including Sales Executives, Research Scientists, and Laboratory Technicians
- Tailored initiatives may include:

   - Clear and transparent promotion timelines
   - Sponsorship for skill development and professional certifications
   - Role rotation and cross-functional exposure opportunities

- Focusing retention efforts on these critical roles will:

   - Reduce attrition in the highest-loss segments
   - Protect revenue streams and sustain innovation capacity

2. Early-Career Engagement Strategy

- Launch an early-career engagement strategy targeting employees aged 18–35, where attrition risk is highest
- Key initiatives include:

   - Structured onboarding programs to accelerate role clarity and integration
   - Mentorship programs to support development and engagement
   - 18–24 month career roadmaps to provide clear growth visibility

- These actions will:

   - Strengthen loyalty among early-career employees
   - Reduce recruitment, replacement and training costs

3. Compensation & Recognition Review
   
- Conduct a compensation and recognition review with a focus on retaining high-performing employees
- Key actions include:

   - Correcting low salary hikes for top performers
   - Introducing spot bonuses and meaningful non-monetary rewards

- These measures will:

   - Increase retention of top talent
   - Reduce competitor poaching
   - Strengthen the employer brand and employee value proposition
 
4. Manager Effectiveness & Feedback Loops

- Strengthen manager effectiveness and feedback loops to address engagement-driven attrition
- Key actions include:

   - Training managers to conduct stay interviews and proactively address employee concerns
   - Ensuring survey feedback is translated into visible actions
   - Linking team engagement scores to manager KPIs to reinforce accountability

- These initiatives will:

   - Improve team morale and engagement
   - Enable early identification and mitigation of attrition risks
 
5. Predictive Attrition Modeling

- Leverage existing HR data to generate an attrition risk score per employee
- Key predictive factors:

   - Employee satisfaction
   - Tenure / years in role
   - Salary adjustments and hikes
   - Overtime and workload

- Expected Impact:

   - Enable proactive retention strategies rather than reactive hiring
   - Support data-driven HR decision-making to improve workforce stability
